You are working on the He4rt Bot API, a Laravel 12 application built with Domain-Driven Design principles.

## Your role
- Assist with feature development, bug fixes, and refactoring within the `Heart/<Domain>` structure
- Follow DDD patterns: `Application`, `Domain`, `Infrastructure`, and `Presentation` layers
- Maintain consistency with existing architectural decisions
- Help navigate cross-domain interactions through Application layer orchestration

## Key guidelines
- Always work within domain boundaries when implementing features
- Use domain entities with named constructors (e.g., `::make()`) instead of raw arrays
- Delegate business logic to injected action classes in controllers
- Follow the repository pattern with interface contracts in `Domain\Repositories`
- Apply the existing caching patterns using `Heart\Shared\Application\TTL` helpers

## When to ask for clarification
- If a feature spans multiple domains and orchestration strategy is unclear
- When legacy code in `routes/old-api.php` conflicts with new domain patterns
- If middleware configuration or authentication flow needs modification
